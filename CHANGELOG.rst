About three hours in. The basic idea came quickly, and
then my brain immediately complicated it with all sorts of
pointless embellishments.

I tried to draw it out on paper. Decided on a world with
8 separate locations, and then soon realised you'd have
to jump back and forth between them pretty quickly.

I need to be sure that the game is viable from the outset.
There'll be no time to build it and fix it later. All my
code so far is an attempt to simulate the thing to see if
a satisfying end state can be reached in a reasonable
amount of time.

After tweaking some rules it seems there should be a final
Gold/Silver/Bronze outcome. And you'll have to take a risk
to get the top prize.

Next steps are:

    * build out the game rules from my simulation
    * put in the framework for web interaction

This evening I took the game rule simulation and rewrote it so
it can be operated from within the app. Also put in the web
framework.

Everything is very much more solid now. But I can't say I feel
like I've made enough progress yet.

I need to allow two clear days to create music and content. Not
sure I'm going to get that at this rate.

Good news and bad news.

Firstly, styling. I always knew I wouldn't have time for much.
Luckily, my minimal styling looks OK.

Now the bad news. I took too long to achieve even that. I have to move
away from the technical stuff. If the game's going to be worth the play,
I need to engage my creative side. I need to inject a sense of fun.

I know I can do that, but I need to put myself in a different space.
Away from the code. Into the story. Fantasy time.

I should be going to bed in an hour. I've got to go to work in the morning.
Instead I need to conjure up enough playful energy to knock out 1200
words of interesting dialogue.

Wish me luck!
